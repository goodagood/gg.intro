# The Name 
( [中文版本](./cn/intro.md.html) )

`goodogood` get `good` on left and right side of the letter `o`,
it's a domain name and it happens has a dog comes into the middle of the name.

`goodogood.com` is developing as an file sharing project,
it's open source with codes repositories at `github.com/goodagood/gg2`.
`goodagood` with 'a' instead of 'o' connect 2 good is brother of goodogood.

Software is a kind of engineering, it can be pleasure to enjoy,
and it has good chance to turn into a lot hardworking and brain twisting.

`File` is one of the basic concepts underlying the whole computer science and engineering,
it's such kind of software that it can be complex and
cross linking to all of system processes, 
using many protocols and talking to different interfaces. 
It will definitely becomes hugh challenge when it designed to scale up on vast networks. 

Even more, if we let files be selled and bought, things going to crash on
itself.

There are tons of reasons why I like to do stupid things, I can go to details
if we have more time.


# Why we do things in stupid ways


We think it long time before, there is 
a long story of history started from a grain of sand


    To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
    And Eternity in an hour.

	- William Blake


It's not relevent to software specifically, but it tells who we are,
why we come, and how we are going to do things.

The story not finished translating into English,
it's not guaranteed to be all correct,
it's a process to gather proved facts when all science is evolving.


# Beside the file share-ing


Beside the goodogood file system and the story, there are a few things I
also want to do:

	1 wheel package system to save energy in outdoor trails.
	2 wheel motorcycle with front wheel change to electric driven.
	3 wheel with 2 front wheels to carry more solar panels
	4 wheel solar RV or mortor-house like vehicle

Yes, I get no time/money to do many of the above, so all of them are open
sourced project asking people to do it.
