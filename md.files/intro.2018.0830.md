`goodogood` gets 2 `good` around the central letter `o`. 

`goodogood.com` is developing as an file sharing project,
it's open source with codes repositories at `github.com/goodagood`.
`goodagood` is brother of goodogood.

For some, file sharing system is easy as a piece of cake, 
especially for those who never got trapped deep into any software project.
Software can be hard enough by it's own, same as most kind of professional engineerings.
And maintainance of such kind of software is sort of job that genius not going to undertake by themself.

For those who can repect computer science,
we know that file is one of the basic concepts underlying the whole computer science and engineering,
it's such kind of software can be complex and
cross linking to all of system processes, internally using many protocols, 
and facing all of different interfaces. 
It also becomes hugh challenge when it designed to scale up on vast networks. 

From now on, if we let file be selled and bought, things going to enter into maze of mysteries.

As it is,
doing with file system is as simple as a few hours coding, in same time,
it can be as complex as to change the whole world.

But `goodogood` is simple enough, 
it just an easy to read name not occupied by other domain owners,
and it is inviting people to come to help the simple open source project,
and enjoy the happiness.



# A long history started from a grain of sand


From poetry of William Blake

    To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
    And Eternity in an hour.


We assemble a billion years history for a grain of sand. 
It's un-relivent
