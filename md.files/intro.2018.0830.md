`goodogood` gets 2 `good` around the letter `o`. 

`goodogood.com` is developing as an file sharing project,
it's open source with codes repositories at `github.com/goodagood`.

`goodagood` is another name I used, it's an alternative, 
it can give convenient URL during upgrading.

For those who thinks file sharing system is not so hard to setup.
Yes, it can be a piece of cake, 
but any kind of useful software can also turn out to be very hard,
and maintainance of such kind of software is kind of job genius not going to undertake by themself.
Even more, if we can acknowledge that file is one of the basic concepts underlying the whole computer science,
we know this kind of software can be complex cross linking to all kind of applictions and protocols.

In the same time, a simple file system can grow up to be anything people can image.
We just want it can be good.
