`goodogood` gets 2 `good` around the central letter `o`,
and it happens has a dog in the center of the new word.

`goodogood.com` is developing as an file sharing project,
it's open source with codes repositories at `github.com/goodagood`.
`goodagood` is brother of goodogood.

For some, file sharing system is as easy to develope as a piece of cake, 
especially for those who never got trapped deep into any software project.
Software can be hard enough by it's own, as hard as most kind of professional engineering chalenges.
And the maintainances of such kind of software is sort of job that many genius not going to undertake by themself.

For those who can repect computer science,
we know that `file` is one of the basic concepts underlying the whole computer science and engineering,
it's such kind of software that it can be complex and
cross linking to all of system processes, 
using many protocols and talking to different interfaces. 
It will definitely becomes hugh challenge when it designed to scale up on vast networks. 

Even more, if we let file be selled and bought, things going to enter into maze of mysteries.

But forget the complex of engineering, `goodogood` is simple, 
it just an easy to read name
inviting people to come to help the simple open source project,
and enjoy the happiness.


# A long history started from a grain of sand


From poetry of William Blake

    To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
    And Eternity in an hour.


We assemble a billion years history for a grain of sand. 
It's not relevent to software specifically, but it tells who we are,
why we come, and how we are going to do things.

The billion years history not finished translating to English,
it's not guaranteed to be all correct,
it's a process to gather proved facts when all science is evolving.
