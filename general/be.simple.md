## Basically, it is an:



**Online File Sharing**
<i class="mdi mdi-folder-multiple-outline"></i>

User can upload *files*, organize it into **folders**, control it's accesses
of reading writting and executing.  `Share` the files, so the job and joys with
friends, team and colleges.


**File can Has Value**
<i class="mdi mdi-square-inc-cash"></i>

When it has attribute of *value*, the labor of doing with files gets
*focuses*, it improve efficiency.  Each and all file can has `value` and other
attributes, but by default the value attribute is empty to keep compatible to
the old way.  So as other attributes, and it can be multiple and powerful.

In consequences, everyone can value their contribution by using or developing
our system.  Then, every one can get more `positive values`, they can be users,
programmers, managers, organizers, street runners, ..., the list keeps on and on.


**Negative Value Exists**

If we collecting the
<i class="mdi mdi-minus"></i>
**negative** value with files.  We can find a way to
clear it, the world may be cleaned.

*OK*, let's keep things short, or it can continue to become quite long.

# Call the Rest the Long Story

## I am a stupid engineer

I am doing stupid engineerings, it is to setup a *file system*, using it as
`interface` between myself and the internet.  [goodogood.me][goodogood] is the
stupid file system, it's online and gives all file a *value* attribute.

## It can be many things

File system is one of
<i class="mdi mdi-diamond"></i>
diamonds we dug out in engineering history, it's **simple and
elegent**, in concepts and in practices.  We can implement a lot system to help
each other when *file system* deployed: beside text files, photo files, video
files, we can do functions on file system such as: chatting, meeting,
developing in team, ...

## To save shoulders

Every one need use *less* web UI. Long time using of it leads toshoulder and
back pains,it candemage muscles, bones and nerves during it's numerous small
and tedious movements among mouse, keyboard and touch screen. You can use a
file system to kill job more faster.

## To value all files

File should be able to get a price tag, like all the other commodities in
market. One work on his file should not be prevented to claim value for it.
Value is one of the mysterious things no one can truelly understand in our
mortal world. Just do it anyway.

## To value codes

Start from ten cents a byte, 0.10$/Byte, or how much your software codes
should value? We got a lot of free codes to use. Should we think it's value as
"0", because it's free? A gentleman share his food to others, it's his
kindness and the food is free. But the food keep it's value, it isn't down to
"0", even you can get it freely.

## To clear negatives

If we collect it, we can clean it. The negative value means it's opposite to
the positive value. For positive value, a buyer might pay out cashes to get
the value from it's holder. For negative value, it should be reversed, the
value holder should pay out in some way, to the value claimers.

## To make you rich

Once value start accumulation, we split it by golden ratio, and make sure 20
get 80 and 80 get 20. Always, it's good to split away a golden ratio, and pass
it through the system layers.

## The crashing system

The system can crash often, during to it's growing speed and the man/monthes
requirements to maintain and developing it. It's good to be used as a
temperory file system.

## Open source with value

It's [open source](https://github.com/goodagood/gg.git), GPL licensed. Beside
the source repository, User could start to do hackings inside their folder.
For designers and developers, js css html images, ... all file can be served
from each folder, node.js codes can run from folder, it's easy enough.

## The sportsman like

For those who'd like to run and shoot with fast athelet movings, you are
welcomed to run into streets, shooting those negative valued behaviors, and
claim value for it.

## The managers

Who want manage things, can also get plenty from the system. We are going to
split it by golden ratio before value turn into cash, managment efforts can
get over 38% percent of the value.

## The cognition concepts

Files and folders is by far one of the better tools to follow human
cognitions, it follows categories and concepts. They are by far one of the
best interfaces to our life and jobs ...

## Sharing the good

File system can support better sharings, especially for professionals. If
chances permit it, I can show you we can carry out most kind of tasks by a
shared file system. It can be communication tools, it can be entertainments,
it can be labor sharing, and more.
