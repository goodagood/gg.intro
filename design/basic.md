A file system,

  > Sharing, online, cross devices, easy switch between public and private
  > Value, file should has value attribute
  > Easy to use good tools, most of them in Unix/Linux systems
  > Size-able, at least over a few hard driver each
  > Versatility for file types, presentations, addons
  > Stupid man should be allow to use and hack or expand the system

It has been build a prototype system proving the concepts, Although the
prototype crash oftenly.  Where amazon s3 is use as storage, json is used for
meta data of file and folders, uuid is used when conflicts appear in name
spaces.

Resid is used as database, it's by chance.  I am trying to sperate session
data out from `redis` data store.
